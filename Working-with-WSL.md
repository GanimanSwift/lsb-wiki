# Working with WSL

## Build Speed

If you're going to build from WSL, it's better to clone your repo to somewhere like `/home/`. It is _incredibly_ slow to use `/mnt/c/`.

## Connecting to MariaDB on Windows from WSL

Find the nameserver:

```sh
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

```ini
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
nameserver 172.18.64.1
```

NOTE: This IP appears to change on WSL startup, you'll have to come in here and fetch the new IP whenever it changes.

Set the IP found here in `network.lua` settings.

```lua
xi.settings.network =
{
    SQL_HOST     = "172.18.64.1",
```

If you need to give your WSL instance permissions to use MariaDB, you can create a user for it:

```sql
CREATE USER 'root'@'172.30.167.123' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'172.30.167.123' ;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
