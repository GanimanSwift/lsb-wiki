## What works? Is quest X implemented?

## Do you have a Discord I can join?

We prefer to work through GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/issues), [Pull Requests](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/pulls), and [Discussions](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/discussions).

## Where can I find servers to play on?

Check out the Final Fantasy XI Private Servers Community [List of Servers](https://github.com/XiPrivateServers/Servers/tree/main/servers). You can also head to the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/msACzWV) & [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIPrivateServers/).

## Is there a GM command that does X?

All available GM commands, with descriptions and the level of GM they require, can be found [here](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/tree/base/scripts/commands).

## When will feature X be completed, when will bug Y be fixed?

We practice [clean room engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design), which means we have to implement everything from scratch. As such, progress is slow and difficult. We are also trying to balance feature development, bugfixes, performance improvements, exploit resolution, code review, and testing.

This project is maintained entirely by volunteers in their spare time. We can't and won't ever guarantee any timelines for features or bugfixes. Sometimes the maintainers have lots of time to work on the project, sometimes they have none, sometimes they just don't feel like it and want to go outside and touch grass instead.

The fastest way to get new features or bugfixes is to roll up your sleeves, get in there, and start working on them :)!

## Can I pay someone to implement feature X?

We will never accept financial or material incentives for our work. This is a hobby project. External incentives would drive developer and staff time in a way that makes it no longer a hobby.

## The code for feature X is available in the community, why haven't you taken it?

Features in LandSandBoat are those that have been submitted to us, meet our standards for quality and accuracy, and that we have had the time to review and integrate with the rest of the codebase. It is very rare that we will accept code on someone else's behalf. While there is technically nothing stopping us, it would undermine our position in the community.

Similarly, sending us code snippets creates more work and strain on staff and developers. If you have code you want to contribute, please speak to us with GitHub Issues, Discussions, and open a Pull Request.

## Can I use Trust: X, why doesn't Trust: Y do anything?

Go check their status [here](Trusts).

## When can I play "Classic" Dynamis?

You can't - it isn't in the game anymore.

<p>

"Classic" Dynamis was removed from the game in 2011. The spawn mechanisms as you remember them are gone from the game, and those zones no longer act the way they used to.

The overall project goal is to emulate the retail game as closely as possible, so a massive custom solution to approximate "Classic" Dynamis is not on our roadmap.

## Can I change job X to play like job Y, Can I create an entirely new job?

No.

There are _many many_ things are enforced by the game client.

For instance; you can set your jobs to be 75NIN/75BLM but you won't be able to equip Lv75 BLM gear - this is enforced by the client.

Bypassing these restrictions would need heavy client modification (which we don't support) or support scripts and changes in core.

## Why isn't Yell/Trust/Auction House etc. available in every zone?

What's available to use per-zone is controlled with the `misc` flags column in `zone_settings.sql`. These flags correspond to the `ZONEMISC` enum in `zone.h`. A query to modify those flags can be found in [Useful SQL queries](Useful-SQL-queries#enable-zonemisc-features-everywhere).

```cpp
enum ZONEMISC
{
    MISC_NONE       = 0x0000,   // Able to be used in any area
    MISC_ESCAPE     = 0x0001,   // Ability to use Escape Spell
    MISC_FELLOW     = 0x0002,   // Ability to summon Fellow NPC
    MISC_MOUNT      = 0x0004,   // Ability to use Chocobos and mounts
    MISC_MAZURKA    = 0x0008,   // Ability to use Mazurka Spell
    MISC_TRACTOR    = 0x0010,   // Ability to use Tractor Spell

    MISC_COSTUME    = 0x0040,   // Ability to use a Costumes
    MISC_PET        = 0x0080,   // Ability to summon Pets
    MISC_TREASURE   = 0x0100,   // Presence in the global zone TreasurePool
    MISC_AH         = 0x0200,   // Ability to use the auction house
    MISC_YELL       = 0x0400    // Send and receive /yell commands

## What is Darkstar Project (DSP), Project Topaz (TPZ), or Topaz Next (TPZN)?

These are the predecessor projects that LandSandBoat is derived from, which are archived and no longer maintained or supported.

## Why did the airship in Sauromugue Champaign used to skid along the ground like a land speeder?

It's the project namesake. It's a feature, not a bug. ðŸ‘€

You can re-enable this using the [lsb_mascot.sql](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/blob/base/modules/custom/sql/lsb_mascot.sql) module.
