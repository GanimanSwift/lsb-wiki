## Example of making changes (command line)

- Before you start, make sure the editor `git` will use is set to `vim` using:
  - `git config --global core.editor "vim"`

-----

- `git status`

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- `git checkout -b`

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git checkout -b add_new_files_for_tutorial
Switched to a new branch 'add_new_files_for_tutorial'

PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git status
On branch add_new_files_for_tutorial
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- `git status` with changes

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git status

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        New_File.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

- `git add`

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git add .\New_File.md

- Reviewers ask you to fix your commits, since "Forgot to add link to new file, oops!" is not a great commit message
- How many commits are you going to walk back? We have 2, so we'll walk back from our current place (HEAD) to 2 commit behind (HEAD~2).

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git rebase --interactive HEAD~2
```

- The text editor `vim` will pop up

```ps
pick 590ed78 Add New File for git tutorial
pick 9518095 Forgot to add link to new file, oops!

# Rebase bcf5ad4..9518095 onto bcf5ad4 (2 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

- Press `i` to enter `--INSERT--` mode to make text changes.
- Change `pick` to `squash` for any commits you want to squash into the commit that preceeds them.

```ps
pick 590ed78 Add New File for git tutorial
squash 9518095 Forgot to add link to new file, oops!
```

- Press `ESC` to exit `--INSERT--` mode.
- `:w` to write the file (to save it).
- `:q` to quit vim.
- (You can also just use `:wq`)
- You'll then be prompted to rewrite your commit message (press `i` for `--INSERT--` mode again, `:wq` to save and quit)

```ps

- Now the commits on your local branch are different to the commits on your remote branch

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git status
On branch add_new_files_for_tutorial
Your branch and 'origin/add_new_files_for_tutorial' have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki>
```

- If you try to push, you'll be rejected because git doesn't know how you want to resolve these differences.

```ps
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki> git push
To github.com:LandSandBoat/lsb-wiki.git
 ! [rejected]        add_new_files_for_tutorial -> add_new_files_for_tutorial (non-fast-forward)

hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
PS C:\ffxi\lsb-wiki>
```

- You know your local branch is correct, so you can `--force` push it onto your remote, replacing the remote commits with your local commits.

## Amending the previous commit

If you've made a small mistake and need to quickly amend it, or your work is only a single commit, you can skip the full rebase process and just use `git commit --amend`.

## Git Attribution

Everyone likes to be credited for their work. Nobody likes to have someone else claim the credit for their work (knowingly or not). For this reason, we think you should be actively trying to attribute commits to other people where relevant.

Projects come and go, patch notes will be lost over time, but the git history is forever!

You can attribute in multiple ways:

### Full Author

If you are fully taking someone else's work, and modifying it to fit your needs, you should do this as two commits:

1: Take the work as-is

2: Modify it to your needs

For commit number 1, you should commit it with: `git commit -m "Commit message" --author "Author Name <authoremail@gmail.com>"`

In this case, you will be the committer, and they will be the author.

### Co-Author

If you have been working closely with someone, and need to credit them (or you're referencing their work), you can add their information as a co-author in your commit message:

```txt
Commit title

Commit body

Co-authored-by: name <additional-dev-1@example.com>
Co-authored-by: name <additional-dev-2@example.com>
```

## Other Useful Commands

```sh
# Number of commits per author since date
git shortlog -s --since="01 Jan 2021"

# Contribution statistics since "1 year ago"
git log --shortstat --since "1 year ago" | grep "files changed" | awk '{files+=$1; inserted+=$4; deleted+=$6} END {print "files changed", files, "lines inserted:", inserted, "lines deleted:", deleted}'

# Count commits since date
git rev-list --count --after="Jan 1 2021" --all --no-merges
```
