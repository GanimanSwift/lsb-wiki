# Main Supported Platforms

<details>
  <summary>Windows 10</summary>
  
  ## To Install
  * Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), accept defaults, change default text editor if desired.
  * Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), check Desktop development with C++.
  * Install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), use defaults, set a root password.
  * Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), check to add to PATH.
  * Open a PowerShell window and navigate to your chosen install directory.
  * Download the latest code, install Python requirements, and copy the configuration files:
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server.git
    py -3 -m pip install -r server/tools/requirements.txt
    cp server/settings/default/* server/settings
    ```
  * Edit the file `network.lua` inside `server\settings\` and change "root" to the password set during MariaDB setup
    * Make sure to leave the quotation marks surrounding the password!
  * Edit the file `main.lua` inside `server\settings\` with your desired settings for your server.
    * Make sure to leave the quotation marks surrounding that has them around it!
  * Back in your PowerShell window, navigate to `server\tools\` and build the database:
    ```
    py -3 dbtool.py
    ```
  * Follow the on-screen instructions.
  * Open the `server` root folder in VS2019.
  * [Build the solution in VS2019.](CMake-Build-Guide)

  ## To Update
  * Open a PowerShell window and navigate to your `server` directory.
  * Stash any changes you've made and pull the latest code from upstream:
    ```
    git stash
    git pull
    git stash pop
    ```
    ⚠️ Pay attention! If you stashed any changes, there is a chance you will see the following:
    >CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in _**some file**_

    ⚠️ If this happens, you need to manually edit the conflicting files before continuing.
  * Navigate to `server\tools\` and update the database:
    ```
    py -3 dbtool.py update
    ```
  * Open the `server` root folder in VS2019.

  <summary>Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)</summary>
  
  ## To Install
  * Use your package manager to install the following packages or their equivalent:

    <details>
      <summary>Debian/Ubuntu</summary>

      ```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip g++-10 cmake make libluajit-5.1-dev libzmq3-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev mariadb-server libmariadb-dev
      ```
    * **Debian 10/Ubuntu 18.04:** See the [Linux Setup Guide](Server-Setup-and-Maintenance-Linux#install) for information about upgrading to and building with g++-10.

    <details>
      <summary>Arch</summary>

    ```
    sudo pacman -S git python3 python-pip gcc cmake make luajit zeromq openssl zlib mariadb
    ```
    * Arch users will need to initialize and start the database software if not done already:
      ```
      sudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
      sudo systemctl enable mariadb
      sudo systemctl start mariadb
      ```
    </details>

  * Download the latest code, install Python requirements, and copy the configuration files:
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server.git
    pip3 install -r server/tools/requirements.txt
    cp server/settings/default/* server/settings
    ```
  * Run the following script to improve database security:
    ```
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```
  * Type the following to create a database user with the login <ins>_**xi**_</ins> and password <ins>_**password**_</ins>, and an empty database called <ins>_**xidb**_</ins>. NOTE: You _SHOULD_ change **ALL THREE OF THESE** to improve security:
    ```
    sudo mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE USER 'xi'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';CREATE DATABASE xidb;USE xidb;GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON xidb.* TO 'xi'@'localhost';"
    ```
  * Edit the file `network.lua` inside `server/settings/` and change "root" to the password set during MariaDB setup
    * Make sure to leave the quotation marks surrounding the password!
  * Edit the file `main.lua` inside `server/settings` with your desired settings for your server.
    * Make sure to leave the quotation marks surrounding that has them around it!
  * In the `server` directory, prepare and build the executables:
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j $(nproc)
    ```
  * Wait for the build to complete, then move to `server/tools/` and build the database:
    ```
    cd ../tools
    python3 dbtool.py
    ```
  * Select 'Reset DB' and follow the instructions to "reset" the database.

  ## To Update
  * Open the `server` directory in a terminal.
  * Stash any changes you've made and pull the latest code from upstream:
    ```
    git stash
    git pull
    git stash pop
    ```
    ⚠️ Pay attention! If you stashed any changes, there is a chance you will see the following:
    >CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in _**some file**_

    ⚠️ If this happens, you need to manually edit the conflicting files before continuing.
  * Prepare and build the executables:
    ```
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j $(nproc)
    ```
  * Wait for the build to complete, then move to `server/tools/` and update the database:
    ```
    cd ../tools
    python3 dbtool.py update
    ```

# Experimental Platforms

_These platforms should work but are not actively maintained or used by the development team. The development team (especially in the case of OSX) might not have the hardware or expertise to be able to help you debug problems on these platforms. Use at your own risk. Good luck!_

<details>
  <summary>OSX</summary>
  
## To Install
  
* Get dependencies from brew:

```
brew install git pkg-config autoconf make cmake gcc openssl mariadb zeromq zmqpp
```

* The version of LuaJIT that you can get through brew is old. You can build and install LuaJIT for your system with:

```
git clone https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT.git
cd LuaJIT
sudo make install MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=$(sw_vers -productVersion) -j $(sysctl -n hw.physicalcpu)
sudo ln -sf luajit-2.1.0-beta3 /usr/local/bin/luajit
```

* Download and build the server binaries:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j $(sysctl -n hw.physicalcpu)
```

From here, the instructions are the same as the Linux builds. Good luck!

NOTE: You may have problems with missing symbols from LuaJIT. This happens if the build system picks up LuaJIT's headers instead of our internal (and expected) ones. We discovered this in [this discussion](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/discussions/1015).

In your CMake configuration, you should see this:
```
-- LuaJIT_FOUND: TRUE
-- LuaJIT_LIBRARY: /usr/local/lib/libluajit-5.1.dylib
-- LuaJIT_INCLUDE_DIR: /Users/runner/work/server/server/ext/lua/include
```

If the `LuaJIT_INCLUDE_DIR` is pointing somewhere other than `<SERVER_ROOT>/server/server/ext/lua/include`, you can change it during CMake configuration by using:
```
cmake .. -DLuaJIT_INCLUDE_DIR=<SERVER_ROOT>/server/ext/lua/include
```

  <summary>Linux (Arch)</summary>
Some users have had success building on Arch, we've been able to reproduce a build using the Docker file below. We can't and won't support Arch as main platform. Good luck!

```
// Arch Container (for reference)
FROM archlinux:latest
WORKDIR /server
RUN echo "Y" | pacman -Syu
RUN echo "Y" | pacman -S sudo
RUN sudo echo "Y" | pacman -S git python3 python-pip gcc cmake make luajit zeromq openssl zlib mariadb
ADD . /server
RUN mkdir docker_build && cd docker_build && cmake .. && make -j $(nproc)  && cd .. && rm -r /server/docker_build
```

<details>
  <summary>Linux (Raspberry Pi)</summary>

**Raspberry Pi 3**

Build instructions should be the same or similar as a regular Linux build. The build process may take a long time, but running the game doesn't take much computing power. You should use a suitably powerful and stable power supply!

**Raspberry Pi 4**

As above, the instructions should be the same as a regular Linux build, with one exception: You must use a suitably modern version of LuaJIT. This comes by default with Ubuntu 21.04 onwards. Or you can build LuaJIT from source (see our OSX build for more details). You should use a suitably powerful and stable power supply!

<details>
  <summary>Docker</summary>
We have had users appear and write a Dockerfile for us. None of the main devs use Docker in our regular workflows and are not particularly familiar with workflows or best practices. We can't provide support if you decide to use it. Good luck!
